# Start-Up Classifier

## Introduction
Israel is well known as the startup nation of the world with a great entrepreneurial community and great minds working together making new technoligical breakthroughs.  

What makes Israel the startup nation?  
Well, that answer was not answered by Avinoam ðŸ¤“, so instead we'll try and see if the startup you thought of with your friends or the one your dad thought about while scrolling facebook on the toilet is actually something worth pitching to the Shark Tank.

Our goal is to try and see if your dream might come true âœ¨.  
To be honest, success is definately a relative concept and we try not to dream too much and get disappointed. So we defined the criterias of success to be one or more of the following:
- **A company that raised over ðŸ’²4M** 
- **Got acquired (WooHoo with EXIT ðŸ¥³ðŸ¤‘)** 
- **Is an active and public company**
- **If the company is active and the product is released.**

There is a great website that shows information about the Israeli startup ecosystem and we decided to try and see if our ðŸ¤– can scrape it and give us some interesting insights ðŸ’¡.

The [Start-Up Nation Finder](https://finder.startupnationcentral.org/) website has access to over 10,000 companies, each company and her story.
The story begins at the beginning where the company was founded.
Then, the founders need to develop a product, raise money and start selling.

In the journey ahead, we'll take you to the core of the data of the Start-Up Nation.
